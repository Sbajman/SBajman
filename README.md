## Projects ( New Project Update In Progress)
- **Data Pipeline S3 to DynamoDB** – Implemented Data Pipeline to export millions of records exported to s3 and stored as JSON files. The stored JSON files were exported to DynamoDB. 

- **COMPLETE CICD-PIPELINE A GITOPS APPROACH** 
Implemented CICD pipeline that demonstrates CI/CD architecture applicable to Real-world DevOps & MLOps practices:
  * CI (Continuous Integration): Github, Jenkins, sonarqube, Dockerhub-registry.
  * CD (Continuous Deployment): Github, Helm, ArgoCD (GitOps model)
  * Containerization: Docker.
  * Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s, minikube/kind local testing)
  The pipeline ensures that Git is the single source of truth, and all deployments are declarative, version-controlled, and automatically reconciled.
  * Summary: CI builds artifacts and updates a GitOps repository, while CD is fully decoupled and driven by ArgoCD, enabling scalable, reusable pipelines across multiple services


- **CockroachDB Cloud Metrics Exporter Service** – 
  Wrote a python-based exporter to scrape metrics and export it to Prometheus, Grafana monitoring dashboards were created for visualization
  
- **RAG HR Assistant Chat App** – Implemented RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline that combines the capabilities of pre-trained LLM (Ollama) and external vector data-store FAISS. 
- **Kubernetes RBAC Automation Tool** – Built a Go service to automate Kubernetes Role-Bindings to harden role-based access control for production namespaces.
- **Banking-Support-Multi-Agent-AI Application** – Designed and implemented a multi-agent AI assistant that can
